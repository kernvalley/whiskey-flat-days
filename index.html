	<section itemprop="text">
		<p>One of the most popular Festivals in all of Southern California.  Just a short
		3 hour drive from Los Angeles, you will find the quaint town of Kernville,
		home to Whiskey Flat Days (50 miles east of Bakersfield on Hwy 178).  Whiskey
		Flat Days is held every Presidents Day Weekend.  It is a leap back to the good
		ol' Wild West Days when the area was settled by gold miners, cattle ranchers
		and trappers. Join us when Kernville reverts to its old name "Whiskey Flat"
		for four nostalgic days of fun for the entire family. Parade, <a href="/events/#9027fbbc-9e1c-4f05-a92a-10ef29cbc4dc">Wild West Daze

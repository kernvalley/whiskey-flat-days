It's almost Whiskey Flat Days again! And it's essential to stay informed about
the weather and road conditions to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.
Here's a detailed forecast for the festivities:


### Friday
Kickstarting the weekend, Friday promises partly cloudy skies, offering a pleasant
high of 63째F and a cool low of 46째F.  Pleasant weather for the [Whiskey Flat Encampment](/events/#ea262b89-22f4-4fb5-adaf-4f8780ee474d) and [Iron Horse Rodeo](/events/#c8bf2ead-cd88-407c-9c70-30cb7289c24b).

The morning begins with partial clouds, gradually giving way to increasing cloud cover by late morning. As the afternoon unfolds, there will be a chance of rain. Plan for a high of 61째F and a low of 41째F, and consider packing accordingly for potential showers during the evening festivities.

  <figcaption>178 East and West are Open, but Sierra Way (from Weldon to Kernville remains Closed). The Route to Kernville is taking the 178 to the 155.</figcaption>
</figure>

- **Kern Canyon:** The Kern Canyon HWY 178 through Bakersfield is open, but be ware that one lane is closed due to ongoing road work.
- **Walker Pass:** This route is open and expected to be clear throughout the weekend. However, in the winter, it's advisable to carry chains, especially when traversing high mountain areas.
- **155 from Lake Isabella to Kernville:** Good news - this route is open, providing an probably the main route for those seeking passage to Kernville.
- **Sierra Way:** Unfortunately, Sierra Way remains closed. This means only a few extra miles to take the 155 for those coming from the East.

We have a fun-filled and exciting week in store, so be sure to make it up to Kernville
this weekend!

<div class="center">{% include common/youtube.html id="i56sjbROseM" width=769 height=1367 title="Whiskey Flat Days: Cold Plunge" %}</div>

As many of you know, we're running a [{% include common/icon.html icon="link" fill="currentColor" height="18" width="18"%} fundraising campaign]({{ page.author.url }}) to raise money for a
community hub in the town of Lake Isabella. What better way to promote it than
to do a cold plunge in Isabella Lake?

The annual Whiskey Flat mayor campaign is a lighthearted, tongue in cheek way of
raising money for a charitable cause while also keeping the memory of the historic
town of Whiskey Flat alive. The winner is the team that collects the most "bribes"
(donations). This tradition was started in 1958 as a way to raise money for a
community center in Kernville, so it feels like we're coming full circle by
raising for a next-generation community hub.

My character, Powder Packin' Powers, is a fun take on an 1880s gold miner, and
honors my grandfather who ran for honorary mayor of Whiskey Flat Days back in 1969
under the character name "Bull Run Bob".

Visit our [{% include common/icon.html icon="link" fill="currentColor" height="18" width="18"%} campaign page]({{ page.author.url }}) to learn more.

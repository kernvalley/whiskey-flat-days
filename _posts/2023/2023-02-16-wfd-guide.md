## Pack for both Warm & Cold Weather

Weather-wise, the initial mild and cloudy forecast for the weekend has been updated, and it now appears that warmer and clearer weather will prevail. With temperatures predicted to hit 60 degrees on Saturday and Sunday, the turnout is expected to be better.

But it is also expected to be in the mid-30s in the early morning and late in the evening. So, while you might want short sleeves during the peak of the day, you'll also want something warm if you're out late at night or early in the morning. You'll probably want a jacket for the Iron Horse Rodeo and the 
Whiskey Flat Encampment Old West Church Service.

And don't forget that this is a long event spanning a lot of the town of Kernville. Bring comfortable shoes that'll let you walk possibly several miles per day without regretting it afterwards. Your feet will thank you (**Note:** *if you hear voices literally coming from your feet.... that's not normal*).

## Run by the ATM before coming to Kernville

Plan ahead - vendors might not accept credit cards, and ATMs in town tend to be emptied pretty quickly.

Imagine finding the perfect souvenir or a delicious lunch option, only to realize you cannot make the purchase because you don't have cash on hand. How disappointing would it be to leave empty-handed, especially if you'd just waited in line for several minutes?. By carrying some cash with you, you can make sure you don't miss out on any of the exciting things offered by the numerous vendors.

So be sure to hit an ATM on your way to Kernville. 

## Be Prepared when Nature Calls

With all-day events like this, it's inevitable. So when the time comes, know where to go by looking for the restroom icon on the [WFD Map](https://whiskeyflatdays.com/map/). While you're there, you can also find all the upcoming events, local businesses, and much more!

## Skip the Driving & Parking Hassle

With last year's event drawing an estimated 100,000 attendees and limited parking options available, it might be worthwhile considering an alternative to driving. For instance, the Kern Valley Shuttle is a convenient option that provides transportation to and from the event, making it easier for visitors to enjoy the festivities.

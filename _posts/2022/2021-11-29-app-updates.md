Whiskey Flat Days is coming up in a few short months, and it's time for some updates
here. That means there is a bit of a redesign in progress and new features in the works.
That means an even shorter time for this app, since changes need to be basically
complete by the time of the kick-off dinner and the beginning of mayor races.

With the publishing of this post, there is now Whiskey Flat Days news being published
here. I'm hoping to cover anything important that takes place during the meetings
leading up to Whiskey Flat Days as well as the happenings of the mayor races. I'm
also wanting to publish guides on where to stay and eat, history, and perhaps some
sponsored content (local businesses publishing articles to promote their business,
so long as it's appropriate and relates to Whiskey Flat Days).

There has been an <a href="{{ page.store_url }}" rel="noopener noreferrer external">Android App {% include common/icon.html icon="link-external" height="16" width="16" fill="currentColor" %}</a>
for about a year now, and there may be a Windows and iOS/Mac app coming soon. These new apps
are nearly ready to go, but publishing them requires some fees to be listed on their
respective app stores.

### Other things that might be added
- Online bribes/donations for mayor races
- A store selling souvenirs and merchandise
- Online applications for vendors

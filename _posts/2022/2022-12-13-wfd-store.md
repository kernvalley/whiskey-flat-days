### Coming Soon...
#### The Whiskey Flat Days Store

WhiskeyFlatDays.com is adding an [online store](/store/) where you may be able to sell
items &mdash; no registration cost, and no cost per item listed &mdash; it's
completely free for you. Just list the item through the form (coming soon) or by
providing me the the information to enter, wait to get a notification that an
item has sold, and ship it to the buyer. You get the full amount it was listed
at, plus the shipping cost &mdash; the user pays the transaction fees, which will
be covered in the listed price on the page.

### Expected Audience

Last year the WFD App had ~35,000 views and this year is anticipated to get
over 50,000 views in 2023. **Note**: the WFD App isn't limited to just one weekend per
year. It gets traffic primarily from December-March. You will be notified by
text or email every day when a purchase has been made.

### Prohibited items
- Food
- Alcohol
- Tobacco
- Weapons
- Medical Products or items used for health purposes
- Copyright or Trademark protected designs
- To generalize, anything that has extra regulations or violates Intellectual Property

### Status and Plans

The current store page is mostly for demonstration purposes. It shows what listings
may look like, what information will be used for, what sorts of items a user might
find. It also gets the store page found by search engines sooner rather than later.

Within the next month checkout and payments should be completed. And shortly after
that there will be a page for registering and managing inventory &mdash; it's all
manually entered for now.

Sellers will also have profile pages listing only their items, linking to their website,
showing their logo, having their contact info and social links.

### Start Here

You will be required to create an account to manage your inventory. Each listing
will required to have a name, description, image, price, and info for calculating
shipping costs (such as weight and dimensions). You will also need to enter a
quantity so that it may be determined when an item is out of stock.

For the time being, you'll be given instructions and asked the questions after
submitting on the contact page linked below.

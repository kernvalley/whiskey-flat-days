It's that time of year again. We're still three months away from the big weekend,
but work has begun in preparation of Whiskey Flat Days 2023. The Kernville Chamber
is looking for Mayor Candidates (with a deadline to enter of December 7), there
is a Whiskey Flat Days art theme contest with the deadline of Nov. 11, a theme
of "Gunsmoke and Petticoats".

This year, once Mayor Candidates have been announced, I ask that they contact
me to provide a simple profile including the cause they are supporting. They
will also be encouraged to exchange banter as had been done in previous years
in the Kern Valley Sun, and to give a list of their events. They may also provide
links to online donations, if available.

I am also building a store section to buy souvenirs from local (and *only* local)
merchants. These items will be purchased directly from the merchants, similar
to Amazon. Ideally, this would involve shipping from one location to reduce the
cost of shipping multiple items.

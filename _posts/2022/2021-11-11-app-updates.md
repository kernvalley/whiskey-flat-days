Whiskey Flat Days is coming up in a few short months, and it's time for some updates
here. That means there is a bit of a redesign in progress and new features in the works.
That means an even shorter time for this app, since changes need to be basically
complete by the time of the kick-off dinner.

With the publishing of this post, there is now Whiskey Flat Days news being published
here. I'm hoping to cover anything important that takes place during the meetings
leading up to Whiskey Flat Days as well as the happenings of the mayor races.

There has been an <a href="{{ page.store_url }}" rel="noopener noreferrer external">Android App {% include common/icon.html icon="link-external" height="16" width="16" fill="currentColor" %}</a>
for about a year now, and there may be a Windows and iOS/Mac app coming soon. These new apps
are nearly ready to go, but publishing them requires some fees to be listed on their
respective app stores as well as the possibility of them being rejected by Microsoft
or Apple.

There are other things that I would like to add such as online bribes (donations)
for the may races, which would need to be through the Kernville Chamber of Commerce.
I'd also like to add an online store selling shirts, flasks, shot glasses, etc.,
which would require some form of agreement with the Kernville Chamber.

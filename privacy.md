## Privacy Policy
KernValley.US does not track you whatsoever and takes every reasonable effort
to protect your privacy wherever possible. This site stores no cookies of its own

for basic analytics purposes.

The social and share buttons do not share any data with external sites and only
open their corresponding websites/apps upon click. KernValley.US is entirely unaware
of your accounts or usage of these buttons and only opens the necessary share
prompts.

## Security Measures
Modern security practices are used to ensure that no unauthorized content is
allowed to be executed or even embedded. This may interfere with any extensions
you have installed in your browser, but it prevents anything malicious from taking
place.

## Third-Party content

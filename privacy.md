# WhiskeyFlatDays.com Privacy Policy

You may have been expecting the typical <q>Your privacy is important to us</q> sort
of content here, but KernValley.US really does value your privacy and goes to
great lengths to protect user privacy to the extent that is feasible. Unfortunately,
there are just some things that have to be compromised on (*for now at least*).
Should you use any ad-blocker or privacy add-on, everything here will still work
(you may not be able to comment though).

But instead, here you'll see a genuine attempt at improving the privacy of the web
for users. Please, donate to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/),
install [AdBlock](https://adblockplus.org/) or [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/).
Heck, even browse privately/anonymously with [Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/focus/)
or [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) or [Brave](https://brave.com/) or event [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

## Ads Privacy

This site provides ads through `<krv-ads>` / [ads.kernvalley.us](https://ads.kernvalley.us).
These ads are free from any user tracking and only record anonymous engagement,
such as counting views and clicks. In other words, it will be known **that** an
ad was interacted with, but not **who** viewed or clicked the ad. No cookies are
used, no IP addresses are logged, and no personal data is collected at all.

URLs for ads can and will contain minimal tracking information that basically just
informs the site, "hey, this user is coming to your site from the WFD app." Again,
it contains zero personally identifiable information, and is used exclusively to
let advertisers know how effective their ads are.

## Analytics

This site uses Google Analytics to track page views, unique users, and to measure
"goals" and interactions. This data is used, for example, to know the relative
popularity of a give page, to detect issues with performance, to determine if a
certain browser/device has high "bounce rate" that could be an indicator of compatibility
issues, etc. KernValley.US does not collect or use user demographics beyond country-level
data and limited device info (what browser are you using).

Yes, Google is among the worst offenders (along with Facebook) of user privacy out there. If you choose
to block Google Analytics and third-party cookies and such, that is entirely understandable
and I'll freely confess that I do the same (*my recommendation is [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/),
BTW*). But the Google Analytics is just ubiquitous on the web and actually necessary
to filer out bot/crawler/junk traffic when reporting page views & user count.

See the Google Analytics Privacy Policy [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=analytics).

## Social Networks & Sharing

On most pages, you will find share buttons. Unlike most other sites, these components
do not even ping e.g. Facebook until clicked on to share the page. Until you open
the page/app to share, the social network has zero knowledge that you visited a
given page. Obviously all bets are off once you open the Share in the external
app/site though... That's kinda unavoidable.

## Other Third-Party Services

- Unpkg.com - Third-party CDN hosting essential libraries/packages
- Firebase - Used for authentication and various cloud services
- Leaflet - Library used for [WFD Map](/map/)
- Stripe - Used for checkout on [WFD Store](/store/)
- Disqus - Used for comments on [WFD News](/news/)

## Technical Details

- KernValley.US CDN - Most external content will be loaded from this origin,
and it is the Content-Delivery-Network for KernValley.US
- unpkg.com - This is a third-party CDN that hosts essential assets/libraries
- Imgur - Sometimes used for image hosting... No third-party cookies
- Gravatar - Default service used for user avatars... Again, no third-party cookies
- OpenWeatherMap.org - Used for weather services... Yet again, no third-party cookies
- Wherever possible, `crossorigin` and `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` are used
- YouTube embeds use `"youtube-nocookie.com"` domain to limit third-part cookies
- Every third-party service used serves a distinct purpose

### Here is what might be/is tracking you:

- Disqus Comments
- Google Analytics

Disqus is in the process of being replaced. It is a temporary solution.

Google Analytics isn't so easy to replace &mdash; as stated previously, it's just
better at filtering out all of the garbage of bots and crawlers. Blocking this
will not degrade your experience in any way though.

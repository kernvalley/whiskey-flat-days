The mission of The Kern River Kid and Peacemaker Pete is to restore and revitalize the local Rodeo. This cherished tradition has long been a source of pride and unity that they hope to return to its former glory. 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the rodeo’s origination by John E. McNally in 1945. After enduring the economic challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, our community has yet to fully recover. The revival of these beloved events will provide an essential boost to local businesses, create jobs, and offer invaluable opportunities for youth, particularly in a region facing economic hardship. By celebrating the rodeo and its rich history rooted in Western expansion, we aim to expand the hearts and minds of both locals and visitors—introducing a new generation to the cultural significance of these trades. Reviving the rodeo will not only increase local morale but also attract tourism, bringing both national and international attention to Kernville. This event will become a vital driver of economic growth, drawing visitors, supporting businesses, and inspiring pride across the Kern River Valley. Together, we will reignite the spirit of the rodeo and help create a brighter future for our community.
